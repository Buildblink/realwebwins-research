## üé® Headline Formatting Tips

### Use Line Breaks Strategically
```html
<!-- Good: Creates rhythm -->
<h1>
  From Pain Point to<br/>
  <span class="gradient-text">Working MVP</span><br/>
  in Minutes
</h1>

<!-- Bad: No visual hierarchy -->
<h1>From Pain Point to Working MVP in Minutes</h1>
```

### Emphasize Key Terms with Gradient
Apply `.gradient-text` to:
- "Working MVP" (outcome)
- "AI Team" (differentiator)
- "Minutes" (speed)
- "Free" (no friction)

### Keep Mobile-Friendly
- Max 3 lines on mobile
- Each line should make sense independently
- Avoid orphaned words

## üî¨ Headline Testing Framework

### Questions to Ask Before Launching
1. **Is it clear?** (5-second test: do people understand?)
2. **Is it compelling?** (does it make them want to learn more?)
3. **Is it credible?** (do people believe the claim?)
4. **Is it relevant?** (does it match user intent?)
5. **Is it unique?** (could this headline work for a competitor?)

### Evaluation Rubric (Score 1-5 for each)
- **Clarity**: Can a 10-year-old understand it?
- **Value**: Is the benefit obvious?
- **Urgency**: Does it create FOMO?
- **Differentiation**: How unique is this vs competitors?
- **Memorability**: Will users remember this in 24 hours?

**Target Score: 20+/25**
