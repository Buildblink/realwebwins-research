    "content": "## Why Freelancers Undercharge\n\nMost freelancers price based on fear, not value. You think clients will say no if you charge what you're worth.\n\n## The Value-Based Pricing Framework\n\n### 1. Calculate Your Baseline\n\n- Desired annual income: $80,000\n- Billable hours/year: ~1200 (60% of work time)\n- **Minimum hourly rate: $67**\n\n### 2. Add Value Multipliers\n\n- Specialized skill: +30%\n- Urgent timeline: +25%\n- Complex project: +20%\n- High client budget: +40%\n\n### 3. Package Your Services\n\nInstead of hourly, offer:\n- **Starter**: Basic deliverable ($1500)\n- **Pro**: Full service ($3500)\n- **Premium**: White-glove + ongoing ($7500)\n\n### 4. Anchor High\n\nPresent your highest price first. It makes mid-tier seem reasonable.\n\n### 5. Don't Negotiate Down\n\nIf client pushes back, remove scope instead of lowering price.\n\n## Scripts\n\n**When asked your rate:**\n> \"My rate is $X for this type of project. That includes [deliverables]. Does that work with your budget?\"\n\n**Handling objections:**\n> \"I understand budget is a concern. I could reduce the scope to [subset] for $Y instead.\"\n\n## Result\n\nYou'll lose some low-budget clients. That's good. You'll attract clients who value quality and pay on time.",

Redefine Success Metrics\n\nStop measuring:\n- Revenue (too early)\n- Users (vanity metric)\n\nStart measuring:\n- Hours shipped\n- Learning velocity\n- Customer conversations\n\n### 2. Build Momentum Rituals\n\n**Morning:**\n- Review yesterday's wins (no matter how small)\n- Set ONE goal for today\n- 30-min deep work block first thing\n\n**Evening:**\n- Log what you shipped\n- Note what you learned\n- Plan tomorrow's ONE thing\n\n### 3. Find Your People\n\n- Join Indie Hackers community\n- Find 1-2 accountability buddies\n- Share weekly progress publicly\n\n### 4. Celebrate Micro-Wins\n\n- First signup (even if it's your mom)\n- First dollar (even if it's $1)\n- First feedback (even if negative)\n\n### 5.
