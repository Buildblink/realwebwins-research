# Phase 13 & 14 Testing Guide

## üéØ Testing Overview

This guide will walk you through testing all features built in Phase 13 (Intelligence & Personalization) and Phase 14 (Community & Growth Flywheel).

---

## üöÄ Step 1: Run Database Migrations

### Phase 13 Migration
```bash
npm run ensure:phase13-schema
```

**Expected output:**
- ‚úÖ user_events table created
- ‚úÖ workspace_memories table created
- ‚úÖ workspace_outputs.rating column added
- ‚úÖ workspaces.user_id column added

### Phase 14 Migration
```bash
npm run ensure:phase14-schema
```

**Expected output:**
- ‚úÖ profiles table created
- ‚úÖ public_workspaces table created
- ‚úÖ referrals table created
- ‚úÖ workspace_remixes table created
- ‚úÖ workspaces.published_workspace_id column added

### Verify Migrations (Optional)
Check your Supabase dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor ‚Üí run:
```sql
-- Check Phase 13 tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name IN ('user_events', 'workspace_memories');

-- Check Phase 14 tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name IN ('profiles', 'public_workspaces', 'referrals', 'workspace_remixes');

-- Check new columns
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'workspace_outputs' AND column_name = 'rating';

SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'workspaces' AND column_name IN ('user_id', 'published_workspace_id');
```

## üß™ Step 2: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to: http://localhost:3000

## üìä PHASE 13 TESTING

### Test 1: Analytics Tracking

#### 1.1 Workspace Open Tracking
1. Go to `/pain-points`
2. Click any pain point card to open workspace
3. **Check Supabase:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM user_events
   WHERE event = 'workspace_opened'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
   **Expected:** New event with context containing painPointId, workspaceId, category, niche

#### 1.2 Section Generation Tracking
1. In workspace, click "Generate" on any section (Understand, Ideate, Build, or Validate)
2. Wait for generation to complete
3. **Check Supabase:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM user_events
   WHERE event = 'section_generated'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
   **Expected:** Event with section name in context

#### 1.3 Export Tracking
1. In workspace, scroll to right sidebar "Deliverables" card
2. Click "Export as PDF"
3. **Check Supabase:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM user_events
   WHERE event IN ('export_clicked', 'export_completed')
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
   **Expected:** Two events (clicked and completed)

#### 1.4 Copilot Tracking
1. In workspace, scroll to right sidebar "Copilot Input"
2. Type a question (e.g., "What's the best tech stack?")
3. Submit
4. **Check Supabase:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM user_events
   WHERE event = 'copilot_asked'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
   **Expected:** Event with questionLength in context

### Test 2: Dashboard Analytics

1. Navigate to `/dashboard`
2. **Verify displays:**
   - ‚úÖ Total Workspaces count
   - ‚úÖ Sections Generated count
   - ‚úÖ Total Activity count
   - ‚úÖ Active Users count
   - ‚úÖ Recent Activity timeline with events
   - ‚úÖ Top Categories bar chart
   - ‚úÖ Section Generation Breakdown

**Expected:** All metrics should show real data from user_events table

### Test 3: Recommendations System

1. Open any workspace at `/workspace/[painPointId]`
2. Scroll to left sidebar below "Pain Point Snapshot"
3. **Verify:**
   - ‚úÖ "Recommended for You" section appears
   - ‚úÖ Shows up to 5 similar workspaces
   - ‚úÖ Recommendations have category/niche badges
   - ‚úÖ Clicking a recommendation navigates to that workspace
   - ‚úÖ "Highly relevant" badge shows for exact matches

**Check Network tab:** `/api/recommendations` should return similar workspaces

### Test 4: Feedback Rating System

1. Open workspace and generate any section
2. Scroll down in the section content
3. **Verify:**
   - ‚úÖ "Rate this section:" appears below content
   - ‚úÖ Thumbs up/down buttons visible
4. Click thumbs up
   - ‚úÖ Button turns green
   - ‚úÖ Network shows POST to `/api/workspace/[id]/rating`
5. Click thumbs up again
   - ‚úÖ Button returns to neutral (toggle behavior)
6. Click thumbs down
   - ‚úÖ Button turns red
7. **Check Supabase:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, section, rating FROM workspace_outputs
   WHERE rating IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
   **Expected:** Rating column shows -1, 0, or 1

### Test 5: AI Personalization

1. Open multiple workspaces (3-5 different ones)
2. Generate sections in different categories (Marketing, Product, etc.)
3. Open a new workspace in a category you've explored
4. Generate a section
5. **Check logs:** Console should show user context being fetched
6. **Verify:** Generated content should reference your interests (subtle)

**Check Supabase:**
```sql
SELECT event, context->>'category', context->>'niche'
FROM user_events
WHERE event = 'workspace_opened'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

The AI should detect your most-viewed categories and personalize prompts.

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Migrations fail with "exec_sql RPC not available"
**Fix:** Run SQL manually in Supabase SQL Editor
- Copy content from `scripts/migrations/create_phase13_tables.sql`
- Paste and run in Supabase
- Repeat for phase14

### Issue: Analytics events not tracking
**Fix:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL is set
- Check Network tab for failed API calls

### Issue: Recommendations showing nothing
**Fix:**
- Ensure you have multiple workspaces
- Check that workspaces have different categories/niches
- Verify workspace_id relationships in database

### Issue: Published workspace not appearing in showcase
**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check if workspace is actually published
SELECT * FROM public_workspaces WHERE workspace_id = '[your-id]';

-- Ensure published = true
UPDATE public_workspaces SET published = true WHERE id = '[public-workspace-id]';
```

### Issue: Profile page 404
**Fix:** Ensure username exists in profiles table
```sql
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE username = 'testbuilder';
```
